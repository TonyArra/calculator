### ES6 Calculator
Hey Kristin! Your task will be filling out this ES6 skeleton for a small calculator application

Try to style the calculator using CSS only. Minimal HTML changes are allowed.

Any new functions that you include in the Calculator class must be documented using [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/about-getting-started.html).

You will need to fork this repository and submit your code to your Github fork. Please commit your code frequently via Git, such as when you've completed implementation of a function.

Good luck, and have fun!
